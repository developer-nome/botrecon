# Botrecon

---

Botrecon is tool for performing reconnaissance and inspection on web applications that use question and answer bot methods to find potential security vulnerabilities for ethical hacking purposes.
(NOTE: Only perform inspection on applications that you have express written permission to perform.)

The src/core/questions.js file is fully configurable allowing you to add your own custom rules. The initial application contains inspection rules for finding:
- Exposed databases
- Discoverable files
- Disk write permissions
- Token size guardrails
- etc.

Here are some screen shots of the tool:
